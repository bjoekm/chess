CHESS

BACKGORUND
A hobby project for me to practies coding. Particularly decoupling of UI and data. 
To some extent also try to allow for different games (primarly differnt chess versions, but maybe also Ohtello) 
with as few changes as possible 

WHAT IT AIMS FOR
A user interface to allow two players to play a game of chess (hot-seat).
This inlcudes:
- an UI
- some sort of controller
- game objects
- some sort of "rulebook"

Extensions (somewhat in order of priority):

UI extras:
- Higlight possible moves
- board rotation?

Past moves:
- Show which moves which have been made so far. 
- Go back in move list
- Go forward again
- Save and load move lists (preferably competatilbe with mvoelists from world championship)

Timers:
- Show total game time, show time used by each player
- Adapt to a more real chess clock, with some easy mechanism to switch between players
- Allow user to change time settnigs (ie. total amount of time, time gain at certain events etc), preferably though a menu

Differnt game modes:
- Don't know the name but a funny variant where the player that first loses all his pieces wins. 
  In this mode all normal rules apply with the addition that if your able to strike at one of the
  opponents pieces you must do so.
- Othello?
  
Network:
- Enable play over local network

AI:
- very much low priority. Probably in this case try to interface to an existing chess eninge.

Mobile
I'm unsing AndroidStudio for this project, not with the explicit intention of making it to a mobile platform, but
instead just intresting to learn how this IDE works. Possibly intrested in mobile development alter on.
